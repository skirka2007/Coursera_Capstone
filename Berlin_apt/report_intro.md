<h2>Introduction/Business Problem</h2>

Work relocation is very complecated process. One of the key question is finding an apartment for the long-term rent.
It's very challenging to find an apartment in the unknown city in the shortest time. Especially if you don't know local language and don't know borough's feutures. 
My family is going to rellocate to Berlin (Germany) in the next year. I'm going to analyse Berlin boroughs to better understand, where (boroughs and neighborhods) I should search a flat for my family.

<b>Stakeholders/Target Audience</b>: We are not the only family which is going to rellocate to Berlin, so my analysis will be helpfull for all potential relocators. It allows to save the time and make the flat search easier. 

Please note: 
1) This project is about first stage of flat searching - choice of boroughs/neighborhoods.
2) Some information is available only on the borough level, so it will be used for aggregated conclusions.
3) The analysis includes my family preferences (rent cost, migrants situation, boroughs rating, etc), so the observations will be helpful for an average family, but the conclusions will be more sutuable only for my family.
