<h2>Data</h2>

1) First of all I need to match 99 neighborhoods with 12 boroughs of Berlin. It will be a little bit complecated, because I have only separated data for each borough. 
Anyway I'll use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_and_neighborhoods_of_Berlin">wiki data</a>, and match it with the latitides/longitudes using python libraries.

2) The second dataset I'll use is Foursquare venues data with categories for each <b>neighborhood</b>. I'm going to cluster the city depending on the venues type.

3) Then I'm going to analyse each <b>borough</b> for the following criterias (each criteria is clicable to show the data):
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/781217/rent-costs-berlin-areas-apartment-size/">Average monthly rent of apartments</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Berlin">Migrants origin</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://api.placeilive.com/v1/">PlaceILive API for ratings information</a></li>
</ul>

Please note: Working place (or distance to it) is also should be taken to the consideration, but it's an open question for us now, so we'll ignore this factor at this stage.
